Revision history for Tie-FieldVals
==================================

0.31 Fri 05 November 2004
-------------------------

  * (5 Nov 2004) tweaking documentation


0.30 Thu 04 November 2004
-------------------------

  * (4 Nov 2004) improved sort is Nicer
  	Added two more sort types, "title" and "lastword".  This now
  eliminates the need to "nice-ify" fields because they'd been reversed
  for sort-order considerations, such as authors with Lastname,Firstname
  (can now be sorted with a "lastword" sort) or titles starting with "The"
  or "A" can now be sorted with "title" sort (which ignores the initial
  "The" or "A").

  * (4 Nov 2004) just tweaks

  * (3 Nov 2004) added ability to create file if it doesn't exist
  	One needs to set the mode to O_RDWR|O_CREAT and to give
  the field names, if one is creating the file; the default setup
  is still for a file which already exists.
